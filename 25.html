      <p class="cfont">allow yourself to permiss the seed of grief to bloom, to ravish, to decay. let it become <a href="17.html">monsterous</a>. 
        allow your tears to grieve, to seep into the pores of your memories&wash away the apologies of your politicized body.
        let your grief be carried through atmospheres, and let each breath circulates memories of [y]our lifetimes.
        allow for your heart to ftitleer, to stop&be reborn, over and over, not out of survival but to live and to learn to love.
